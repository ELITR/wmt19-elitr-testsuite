Moreover, the SAIs believe that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the nature of the claims (eg VAT, income tax) and the amounts recovered per Member State.
By further analyzing the statistics provided by Member States, the Commission could assist Member States in assessing their anti-VAT fraud policies.
As the recovery rate per Member State can be calculated, the SAIs support the idea that low quota Member States should at least strive for the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role.
The foreign claims for recovery received at the Ministry of Finance CZ were delayed, especially in the years 2006 and 2007, to the responsible FÃ„s.
The same applies to the requests for recovery made by the Czech FZ.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance was in breach of Law No 191/2004 on intergovernmental recovery aid in that it did not notify the competent authority of the requesting Member State within six months from the acknowledgment of receipt of the request for recovery.
4.5 VAT inspection at large companies
4.5.1 Sales tax audit of large companies in the Czech Republic
General
The taxation procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules as other taxable persons.
The audit of large enterprises is regulated by the Czech Law No. 337/1992, the "Tax and Charges Administration Act".
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons established for the purpose of conducting business operations and whose net turnover for the tax period concerned is at least CZK 2 billion according to the income tax or corporation tax return.
The taxpayer is classified as a large enterprise on the basis of the amount of turnover according to income or corporate income tax return in the respective tax period; first time for the year 2003.
