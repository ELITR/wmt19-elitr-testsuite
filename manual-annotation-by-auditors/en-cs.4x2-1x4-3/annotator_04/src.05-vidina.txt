JOINT FINAL REPORT on the Results of Parallel Audits of Excise Duty Administration in the Slovak Republic and in the Czech Republic
Joint Report of the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic
May 2017
Supreme Audit Office, Slovak Republic
Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic
Introduction
This joint report provides information about the course and outcome of international cooperation on parallel audits conducted by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (“Slovak SAO”) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (“Czech SAO”) in the field of excise duty administration in 2012-2015.
The cooperation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of both countries was carried out based on an agreement on cooperation on parallel audits of excise duty administration concluded between them in August 2015.
The topic of the parallel audits was chosen because both EU Member States follow common European legislation on this matter, thereby providing an opportunity to ascertain how European legislation is applied on a national level, how the excise duty administration system is set up, and how the system in Slovakia and the system in the Czech Republic differ.
The greatest benefits of these audits consisted in the exchange of experience, identification of differences and good practice.
Last, but not least, finding out that international comparability of data on efficiency and effectiveness of excise duty administration is extremely limited without performing parallel audits was also beneficial.

Results of Parallel Audits of Excise Duty Administration
Summary and assessment
Legislation in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia on excise duty and its administration complies with EU legislation and exceeds EU requirements substantially.
Differences have been discovered between Slovak and Czech excise duty regulations: in the Czech Republic, verification of the economic stability of applicants for permits and mandatory labelling and dyeing of several mineral and some other oils contribute to effective excise duty administration; in Slovakia, the distribution of excise stamps is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less of a burden on excise duty administrators.
In the fight against excise duty evasion, supervising the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco materials, the implementation of the institute of a transport fuel distributor, and keeping a registry of merchants of consumer packaged alcohol appear to be a good practice in the fight against excise duty evasion.
