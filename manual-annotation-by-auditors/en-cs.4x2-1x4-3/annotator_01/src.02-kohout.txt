Because of some errors in entering data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify some registered import transactions, e.g. when the importer's name was missing or if there was a mistake in the Tax Identification Number (hereinafter â€žTax ID").
Consequently, it is not possible to say with certainty that the import transactions had not actually taken place.
- For 4 export SADs from the Czech Customs Database, the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 399,776., no matching imports were found and proven (see Paragraph 5 above).
In this case, there exists a suspicion of a fictitious export of goods for the purpose of placing an unjustifiable and illegal VAT refund claim.
