Besides pocket money, asylum seekers accommodated in private outside refugee facilities may receive an allowance up to the subsistence minimum.
Section 84 of Ac, no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, as amended, awards municipalities the entitlement to an allowance to cover costs associated with refugee facilities in their territory.
The size of the allowance is fixed every year by government resolution, and amounted to CZK 7 per person per day of stay in the period under scrutiny.
At the same time, municipalities are entitled to an allowance to cover non-investment costs of elementary schools attended by asylum seekers.
The size of the allowance in the period under scrutiny was CZK 120 for every school-going asylum seeker on the condition that the person in question attended school for at least 10 days in the given month.
In the Slovak Republic food allowance was SKK 70 per person per day in the period under scrutiny; pocket money was SKK 12 per person per day and SKK 8 for a child aged up to 15.
The average cost of housing one asylum seeker in an refugee facility per day was SKK 442 in 2001, SKK 447 in 2002 and SKK 445 in 2003.
Under Act no. 480/2002 Coll. (SR), on asylum, municipalities with refugee facilities in their territory receive an allowance to cover part of the municipality's expenditure associated with establishing and running an refugee facility.
So far municipalities have only made partial use of the possibility of applying for the allowance, which is fixed at SKK 1 500 per bed per calendar year.
The national legislation in both countries lays down a 90-day deadline, from the start of asylum proceedings, in which a decision must be issued. In warranted cases this deadline may be extended.
The most common reason for asylum proceedings overstepping this deadline, which has an influence on state budget expenditure, is appeals lodged against rulings not to award asylum.
In the Czech Republic most official decisions are issued after a period of 90 to 180 days (31.54%).
The second greatest number of decisions is issued 90 days or less after the asylum application was lodged (17.61 %).
In total, 73% of asylum proceedings opened in 2001-2003 were officially ruled on a year or less after proceedings commenced.
